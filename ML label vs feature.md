### ML label vs feature

**Label**
`A label represents an output value,`

**Feature**
`A feature is an input value that describes the characteristics of such labels in datasets`

### Examples

`When ML models are used in real life, experts present input data with features to the computer. For example, in a factory, a conveyor belt moves a lot of tomatoes. The ML model captures the features of tomatoes by employing computer vision tools. If the model recognizes such tomato features as its color which is brown or black the label "rotten" is assigned to the fruit, if the color is red, yellow, or orange it means that the tomato is fresh. It is worth mentioning that this is a simplified approximated description of the process.`

`The features have to be uploaded to the computer system as input so that the ML algorithms can generate a label as an output. This is the difference between ML labels and features. The more and better the labeled training dataset was, the better the model will predict labels by features.`
